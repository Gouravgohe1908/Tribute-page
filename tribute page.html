<h1 class="king">  About the Run Machine/King Kohli  </h1> 


                  
<p>Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of Indian 
  national cricket team who plays as a right-handed batsman for Royal Challengers 
  Bangalore in the IPL and for the Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. <br>

Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time,[4] Kohli holds the records 
for scoring most runs in T20 internationals and in the IPL. In 2020, the International 
Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed to
 a number of India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 
 Champions trophy.
 Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and 
 started his youth career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut
  in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team and later made his Test debut
   in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI
    batsmen for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most
     runs scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming
      the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold 
      the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019,
       when he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single
        decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of the 
        Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he
        stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.</p>
